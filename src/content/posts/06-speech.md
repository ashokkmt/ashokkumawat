## üó£Ô∏è Speech and Extempore

In our recent class on Speech and Extempore, we learned how topics can be divided into different types like factual, abstract, opinion-based, and case-based. For example, a topic like <span className = "custom-highlight">**‚ÄúColor of Life‚Äù**</span> can be approached in many ways depending on the type. Understanding these types helps us prepare better and speak confidently on any topic.

### üõë Important Points

- <span className = "custom-highlight2">***Factual topics***</span> require you to present facts and real information.  
- <span className = "custom-highlight2">***Abstract topics***</span> ask you to explain ideas or concepts that are not concrete.  
- <span className = "custom-highlight2">***Opinion-based topics***</span> want you to share your personal views or beliefs.  
- <span className = "custom-highlight2">***Case-based topics***</span> focus on real-life examples or situations related to the topic.  
- **Stand properly and <span className = "custom-highlight2">use your body language to engage the audience.**</span>  

### ‚ùé Common Mistakes

- <span className = "custom-highlight3">Not understanding the type of topic</span> before speaking.  
- Speaking too fast or too slow, which confuses the audience.  
- Using complicated words that are hard to follow.  
- <span className = "custom-highlight3">Going off-topic</span> and losing the main point.  
- Not organizing thoughts clearly, leading to a messy speech.  
- Ignoring body language and failing to make eye contact.  

This class helped me realize that knowing the topic type and preparing accordingly makes a big difference in delivering a strong speech. Clear structure, simple language, good posture, and staying on point are key to keeping the audience engaged. I‚Äôll keep these tips in mind for my next speech or extempore.
