## Movie Review: The Shawshank Redemption

### 1) Favorite Dialogue and Why?

<span className = "custom-highlight">**"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."**</span>

This line, written by Andy in a letter to Red, really stood out to me. It shows how powerful hope can be, especially when things are tough. Even though Andy was wrongly sent to prison, he never gave up. His belief in hope kept him going and eventually helped him escape. This quote reminds me that no matter how hard life gets, hope can keep us moving forward.


### 2) Personal Review

*The Shawshank Redemption* is a truly inspiring film. It’s about friendship, justice, and staying strong even in the worst situations. Andy, the main character, is calm and smart. His friendship with Red, who is more realistic, makes the story feel real and emotional. The film’s slow pace works well—it gives time to understand the characters and their lives.

What I liked most was the ending, when Andy’s escape plan is finally revealed. It was clever and showed how patient and determined he was. Morgan Freeman’s voice as the narrator also made the story more personal and powerful. Overall, it’s not just a prison movie—it’s a story about staying hopeful and never giving up.
