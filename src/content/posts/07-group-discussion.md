## Group Discussion (GD) - Important Points and Common Mistakes

In our recent class about Group Discussions (GD), we learned that GD is <span className = "custom-highlight">**not a team discussion**</span> where everyone works together. Instead, it is a group setting where individuals often try to show their own dominance to win the discussion. This helped me realize that GD is more about <span className = "custom-highlight">**expressing your ideas clearly and confidently**</span> rather than just speaking the most or overpowering others.

### üõë Important Points

- It is **not a team discussion** ‚Äî each person shares their own views independently.  
- Many participants try to <span className = "custom-highlight2">**dominate the discussion to win**</span>.  
- **Listening carefully** is as important as speaking.  
- Stay **relevant and focused** on the topic throughout the GD.  
- Use **simple and clear language** to express your ideas.  
- Avoid **interrupting others unnecessarily**.  

### ‚ùé Common Mistakes

- Trying to **dominate the discussion too much**.  
- **Interrupting others** frequently, which seems rude.  
- Using **complicated or unclear language** that confuses others.  
- <span className = "custom-highlight3">**Going off-topic**</span> and wasting time.  
- <span className = "custom-highlight3">**Ignoring or disrespecting others‚Äô opinions**</span> instead of engaging with them.
- Not making eye contact with group members.  

The class made me understand that a good GD is about <span className = "custom-highlight">**balance ‚Äî being confident but respectful, speaking clearly but listening well, and staying on topic without trying to overpower others**</span>. These small things can make a big difference in how you perform and how others see you.

I will definitely keep these tips in mind to improve my future GD performances.
