## Personal Learnings

- <span className="custom-highlight">As long as I live, there are infinite chances.</span> one should not feed ourself with excuses. Life is giving me constant opportunities to start again.
- <span className="custom-highlight">Luck happens when preparation meets opportunity</span>. Being consistently prepared opens doors I didn’t even know existed.
- <span className="custom-highlight">A bad experience is nothing but a good lesson.</span> Like when I was giving a speech for the first time, it felt like a failure—but it was actually my first step toward improvement.
- <span className="custom-highlight">Skills don't work when I'm lazy.</span> No matter how talented I am.
- <span className="custom-highlight">The only way to see how far you can go is to keep pushing forward.</span> Growth begins where comfort ends. Pushing forward is the reason I’ve discovered I can lead and inspire a team.
- Because of feedback from my mentor, I got to know that I have to work on my mother tongue and have to expand the thinking capabilities.
- Always enjoy life because at the end nothing matters. There is a famous quote - `What is more important, the journey or the destination? The answer is the Company.`
